# Airport Distribution & Economic Analysis

## Project/Goals ðŸŽ¯
- **Objective**: Understand the distribution of airports across various countries and correlate this with economic indicators, primarily GDP and other factors like altitude. The goal is to identify patterns, outliers, and potential growth opportunities in the aviation sector.

## Process ðŸ§ª

### Data Collection ðŸ“¦
- Datasets were sourced from Kaggle.com, focusing on global airport distributions and world data from 2023.

### Data Cleaning & EDA ðŸ§¹
- Undertook rigorous data cleaning for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand data structure and derive meaningful insights.

## Key Results ðŸ“ˆ

### Correlation with GDP:
- Strong positive correlation (approximately 0.82) between countries' GDP and their number of airports.

### Top Countries by Number of Airports:
- The US leads, followed by countries like Canada, China, Australia, and Brazil.

### Airport Types Distribution:
- Diverse distribution observed, with the US predominantly housing large airports.

### Altitude Analysis:
- Countries like Eritrea, Bhutan, and Bolivia have airports at significant altitudes.

### Economic Indicators:
- Identified countries with high GDP but fewer airports than expected, indicating potential growth areas in the aviation sector.

## Challenges ðŸš§
- Data inconsistencies and complex correlations made the analysis intricate at times.

## Future Goals ðŸŒŸ
- Conduct deeper economic analysis.
- Develop predictive models for airport growth.
- Dive deeper into regional airport distributions.
