# LHL-Final-Project-Global-Airport-Analysis-
Explore Airport Distribution, Economics, and Infrastructure.

Project Description

Goal: 
     The goal of this project is to analyze global airport data and provide valuable insights into the distribution of airports, their economic implications, and their correlation with population and infrastructure. Through data-driven analysis and interactive Tableau dashboards, the project aims to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the aviation industry.

Project Description: 
                    This project addresses the need to understand the dynamics of airport distribution, their economic significance, and their relationship with population and infrastructure. By conducting descriptive and comparative analyses, we seek to answer questions about airport density, economic growth, and population impact. Additionally, through interactive Tableau dashboards, users will be able to explore geospatial distribution and obtain in-depth country profiles, enhancing decision-making for various stakeholders in the aviation sector.

Deliverable: 
            The project will result in a comprehensive project description document outlining the objectives, methodologies, findings, and insights gained from the analysis of airport data. Additionally, interactive Tableau dashboards showcasing geospatial patterns and country profiles will be provided to offer a user-friendly exploration of the data.
